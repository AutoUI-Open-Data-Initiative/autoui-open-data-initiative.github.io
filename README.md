# Open Science in Automotive User Research

[![.github/workflows/ci.yaml](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/actions/workflows/ci.yaml) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-theme-cayman.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-theme-cayman)

This is an effort to increase openness and transparency in the automotive user research community. We collect practical tips toward Open Science and give researchers a platform to advertise their openly available research artifacts.

## How to contribute

If you want to link your openly available research artifacts to this website, please create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)  on [GitHub](https://github.com/AutoUI-Open-Data-Initiative/autoui-open-data-initiative.github.io) and add your work here: [Related Works CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AutoUI-Open-Data-Initiative/autoui-open-data-initiative.github.io/master/_data/related_works.csv).
The category must be one of **[Dataset, Software, Model]**. Please make sure your pull requests follow the .csv format.
We will review your submission and approve it as soon as possible.
